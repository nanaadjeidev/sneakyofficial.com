      built using Express.js for the backend and plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS on the front.
      It's raw, hand-rolled, and somehow earned the top mark of the year for my first-year uni project.`,

      Built using Express.js and pure HTML/CSS/JS, with no frameworks—just vibes and HTTP.
      It gamifies health with some tough love, and yes, it got a first-class grade. No regrets.`,

      to get hands-on experience with the language. It helped me solidify fundamentals like input handling, game loops, and basic terminal rendering.
      Nothing fancy—just good ol' ASCII-based gameplay.`,

      My role involves developing scalable backend services in C++ and Python, working on systems that interact with real-time sensor data,
      and deploying solutions with Docker and Kubernetes. It's been a deep dive into high-performance systems and production-grade software.`,

      for 4 mans and 2v2s with automated rank tracking, Discord integration, and player history.
      I've built the entire platform from scratch using TypeScript, Node.js, Express, and React.`,

      My contributions so far include implementing match history views in the stats system and adding a **/fixteams** command to manually set teams after issues with auto-balance.
      Still learning the codebase but actively shipping features and fixes.`,
